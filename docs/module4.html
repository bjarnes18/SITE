        <h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Reflection on Sprint 1</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">What happened with regard to my studies in Sprint 1?</span><br>
            <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> In Sprint 1, I took Marketing, Accounting, and International Business Communication. I struggled with Marketing because I skipped classes, which made studying harder. Outside of class, there were no issues that impacted my progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">How did I feel about each course?</span><br>
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> At the start, I felt Marketing wouldn’t go well because I dislike studying theory. I was right—my results reflected my lack of motivation. In contrast, Accounting went well as I enjoy practical exercises and found it interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">How did others react?</span><br>
            <i class="fas fa-users"></i> My classmates seemed to have a similar attitude towards classes, and their behavior didn’t influence me. Teachers made a difference—like in Accounting, where clear explanations and practical exercises helped me stay focused.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> What Went Well & Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i> <span class="highlight">What went well:</span> Accounting went well because it was engaging, practical, and easier to study.</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <span class="highlight">Negative effects:</span> I struggled with Marketing because I lacked effort and motivation to study theoretical material.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Improvements for Sprint 2</h2>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> <span class="highlight">What can I do differently?</span><br>
            I will study earlier and stick to a schedule. I need to rely on myself and create weekly goals as a first step to stay on track.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Summary of Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-check"></i> Attend all classes, start studying early, and stay consistent—even for subjects you find less interesting.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Learning Question</h2>
        <p>
            <i class="fas fa-question"></i> How can I stay motivated to study subjects I find boring and still perform well in them?
